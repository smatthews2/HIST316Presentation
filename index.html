                    <h1>Hnefatafl, Tawlbwrdd, and Other Board Games</h1>
                        <h2>What games were popular under the Tudor and Stuart regimes?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Board games, such as <a href="http://ninemensmorris.ist.tugraz.at:8080/" target="_blank">Nine Men's Morris</a>
                            (a game thought to have been brought over by the Romans, along with its smaller variants, e.g. Three and Six Men's Morris) 
                            or Tawlbwrdd, a Welsh rendition of Hnefatafl that primarily varied in its setup were enjoyed by many Tudor nobles.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Card games such as <a href="https://www.cassidycash.com/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/2019/03/How-to-Play-Noddy.pdf" target="_blank">Noddy</a> or <a href="https://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/maw.html" target="_blank">Maw</a> were also enjoyed in their respectful periods, with the former being played during the time of Shakespeare and
                            the latter being brought over by Mary, Queen of Scots and played in the court of James VI and I. Both of these games are akin to cribbage or craps.
                        </p>

                    <h1>Legislation and Morality regarding Games/Gambling</h1>
                    <h2>What decrees or statutes were passed to regulate gaming?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Unlawful Games Act of 1541 under Henry VIII outlined a 40-shilling "penalty for maintenance of a house for unlawful games," 
                        but was never enforced due to the royal court participating in such entertainment; Henry VII and Elizabeth of York were reported to have gambled as a pastime. 
                        Mary I was also a notorious gambler, despite having to consistently borrow money from the ladies-in-waiting to keep playing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The 1628 banning of French cards under Charles I caused the production of "facsimilies" within English soil, 
                        leading to the King of Hearts in the standard 52 deck being regarded as the "suicide king" because he's stabbing himself in the head.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Book of Sports under James I outlined what games were "licit" under the Sabbath due to Puritan outrage of idle enjoyment, allowing
                        dancing, archery, leaping, vaulting, May games(and May-poles), and "Whitsun ales and morris dances"; “bear and bull-baiting, interludes, and (at all times in the meane 
                        sort of people by law prohibited) bowling" were explicitly condemned.
                    </p>
                    <h2>John Gerard, S.J. and Avoiding Religious Persecution</h2>
                    <p>
                        "He found us, or so he thought, playing cards.
                        Actually we had put the cards away to attend to better things as soon as the
                        servants had gone downstairs, and we had resumed our game when this
                        gentleman was announced. So he found us sitting at the card-table piled with
                        money.
                        I should explain that whenever I was with Catholics and we had to stage a
                        game in circumstances like these, we had an understanding that <strong>everybody
                        got his money back at the end and that the loser said an Ave Maria for every
                        counter returned.</strong> In this way I often played with brother Digby and others,
                        when there was occasion to act a part and make bystanders think that we
                        were playing for money in good earnest"(Gerard 162).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "So I told Master Roger Lee that the lady had now made up her mind and
                        was ready to become a Catholic and that all she was waiting for was to see a
                        priest. I asked him therefore to break the news that I was one.
                        This he did but the lady would not believe it. She was amazed. “How can
                        he possibly be a priest?” she protested. “Why, the man lives like a courtier.
                        Haven’t you watched him playing cards with my husband—and the way he
                        plays, he must have been at the game for a long time. And he’s been out
                        hunting with my husband, and I’ve heard him myself talking about hunting and
                        about hawking, and he never trips in his terms. No one could do that without
                        being caught out unless <strong>he was thoroughly familiar with the sport</strong>.” "(Gerard 158).
