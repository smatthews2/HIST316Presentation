                    <h1>Hnefatafl, Tawlbwrdd, and Other Board Games</h1>
                    <h2>What games were popular under the Tudor and Stuart regimes?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Board games, such as <a href="http://ninemensmorris.ist.tugraz.at:8080/" target="_blank">Nine Men's Morris</a>
                        (a game thought to have been brought over by the Romans, along with its smaller variants, e.g. Three and Six Men's Morris) 
                        or Tawlbwrdd, a Welsh rendition of Hnefatafl that primarily varied in its setup were enjoyed by many Tudor nobles.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Card games such as <a href="https://www.cassidycash.com/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/2019/03/How-to-Play-Noddy.pdf" target="_blank">Noddy</a> or <a href="https://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/maw.html" target="_blank">Maw</a> were also enjoyed in their respectful periods, with the former being played during the time of Shakespeare and
                        the latter being brought over by Mary, Queen of Scots and played in the court of James VI and I. Both of these games are akin to cribbage or craps.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>MAW DIRECTIONS:</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Everyone places initial bets and deals cards around until a player receives a Jack. That player then becomes the dealer.</li>
                            <li>The player to the dealer's right shuffles and cuts the deck, putting one half to the side.</li>
                            <li>Dealer passes a set of three and a set of two(five cards in total) for each player.</li>
                            <li>Dealer places the rest of the stack on top and flips the top card for the trump suit.</li>
                            <li>Dealer's left hand player leads the first "trick," following a series of guidelines. 
                                The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led, or by the highest trump if any are played, 
                                and the winner of each trick leads to the next.</li>
                            <li>Whoever wins 3/5 tricks or "spoils five"(prevents anyone else from reaching 3/5) gets the pot!</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Trumps:</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Five of trumps ("Five fingers")</li>
                            <li>Jack of trumps</li>
                            <li>Ace of hearts</li>
                            <li>Ace of trumps (if other than hearts)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Order of Cards:</h2>
                        <p>
                            The others rank from high to low according to colour:
                            in heart and diamond : K Q [J] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 [A] ("high in red")
                            in spade and clubs : K Q [J] [A] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ("low in black")
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h2>NODDY DIRECTIONS:</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Everyone places initial bets and cuts cards to determine the dealer via lowest card.</li>
                            <li>Dealer deals five cards, with the non-dealer cutting the cards and NOT LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM CARD. Two stacks are made: bottom and top.</li>
                            <li>Dealer selects card at the top of the bottom stack to turn over, returning the two halves together and placing the flipped card on top of the deck.</li>
                            <li>If the top card's a Jack, dealer gets two points. Each person looks at their hand and counts up any points they have in their hand
                                and calls them out. Your points in your hand get recorded on paper or the peg
                                board.</li>
                            <li>Each player discards two cards to the "crib" to be counted towards the dealer's (or
                                dealing team) points at the end. If you're playing with a 3-card deal, omit this
                                step.</li>
                            <li>Now players take turns playing a card. The top card, called The Starter Card, that
                                the dealer turned up at the start of play, will count towards all points during the
                                game. If you are able to make points with your play, you count (or peg) those points
                                as you go. If you are able to play, but it doesn't add up to any points, you simply lay
                                the card and move on to the next player.
                                As you play, you announce the card total of all cards visible. The showing card total
                                may not exceed 31.</li>
                            <li>If you cannot play a card without going over 31, you announce that (Historians
                                disagree on what to say here, but "Go" or "Pass" will work fine), and play skips you.
                                Everyone else keeps playing as long as they can, recording points as they go, until
                                no one can play without going over 31, or play reaches 31 points on the board.</li>
                            <li>If you play the last card in a round, you get a bonus point.
                                If anyone scores 31 points exactly, that's called the "Hitter" and it's worth 2 points,
                                and ends the round</li>
                            <li>If someone ends the round while you still have cards in your hand, those remaining
                                cards do not count for points and they do not count against you, they are simply
                                reshuffled in the deck to start another round.</li>
                            <li>If you're playing 5-card Noddy, the cards in the crib get collected at the end of of
                                each round, counted for points (include The Start Card as counting towards these
                                points) and those points go to the dealer. In Round 1 only, the non-dealing team
                                gets a courtesy 3 points for not having the crib in round 1. No subsequent rounds
                                will give courtesy points to a non-dealing team.</li>
                            <li>At the start of a new round, the dealer switches and play resumes again. The first
                                team to reach 31 points wins the game. There's no limit to how many rounds of play.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h1>Legislation and Morality regarding Games/Gambling</h1>
                    <h2>What decrees or statutes were passed to regulate gaming?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Unlawful Games Act of 1541 under Henry VIII outlined a 40-shilling "penalty for maintenance of a house for unlawful games," 
                        but was never enforced due to the royal court participating in such entertainment; Henry VII and Elizabeth of York were reported to have gambled as a pastime. 
                        Mary I was also a notorious gambler, despite having to consistently borrow money from the ladies-in-waiting to keep playing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The 1628 banning of French cards under Charles I caused the production of "facsimilies" within English soil, 
                        leading to the King of Hearts in the standard 52 deck being regarded as the "suicide king" because he's stabbing himself in the head.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Book of Sports under James I outlined what games were "licit" under the Sabbath due to Puritan outrage of idle enjoyment, allowing
                        dancing, archery, leaping, vaulting, May games(and May-poles), and "Whitsun ales and morris dances"; “bear and bull-baiting, interludes, and (at all times in the meane 
                        sort of people by law prohibited) bowling" were explicitly condemned.
                    </p>
                    <h2>John Gerard, S.J. and Avoiding Religious Persecution</h2>
                    <p>
                        "He found us, or so he thought, playing cards.
                        Actually we had put the cards away to attend to better things as soon as the
                        servants had gone downstairs, and we had resumed our game when this
                        gentleman was announced. So he found us sitting at the card-table piled with
                        money.
                        I should explain that whenever I was with Catholics and we had to stage a
                        game in circumstances like these, we had an understanding that <strong>everybody
                        got his money back at the end and that the loser said an Ave Maria for every
                        counter returned.</strong> In this way I often played with brother Digby and others,
                        when there was occasion to act a part and make bystanders think that we
                        were playing for money in good earnest"(Gerard 162).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "So I told Master Roger Lee that the lady had now made up her mind and
                        was ready to become a Catholic and that all she was waiting for was to see a
                        priest. I asked him therefore to break the news that I was one.
                        This he did but the lady would not believe it. She was amazed. “How can
                        he possibly be a priest?” she protested. “Why, the man lives like a courtier.
                        Haven’t you watched him playing cards with my husband—and the way he
                        plays, he must have been at the game for a long time. And he’s been out
                        hunting with my husband, and I’ve heard him myself talking about hunting and
                        about hawking, and he never trips in his terms. No one could do that without
                        being caught out unless <strong>he was thoroughly familiar with the sport</strong>.” "(Gerard 158).
